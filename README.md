# Knowledge Tracing in STEM Education Research

Knowledge Inference prepares scholars to leverage techniques that model the knowledge of a student at a specific point in time as they interact with coursework and assessment activities. Techniques introduced in these modules include Bayesian, Logistic, and Deep Knowledge Tracing.
