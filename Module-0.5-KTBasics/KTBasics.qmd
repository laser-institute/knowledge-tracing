## Goal of Knowledge Tracing (KT)

-   Measuring what a student knows at a specific time

## Goal of Knowledge Tracing

-   Measuring what a student knows at a specific time

-   Measuring what relevant knowledge components a student knows at a specific time

## Knowledge Component (KC)

-   Anything a student can know that is meaningful to the current learning situation

-   Skill

-   Fact

-   Concept

-   Principle

-   Schema

-   <http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Knowledge_component>

## Knowledge Component

-   Anything a student can know that is meaningful to the current learning situation

-   Skill: Subtracting two fractions

-   Fact: The capitol of Germany is Berlin

-   Concept: Identifying a simile

-   <http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Knowledge_component>

## Why is it useful to measure student knowledge?

-   Enhancing student knowledge is the primary goal of a lot of education

-   If you can measure it, you know whether you’re making it better

-   If you can measure it, you can inform instructors (and other stakeholders) about it

-   If you can measure it, you can make automated pedagogical decisions

## Different than measuring performance

-   You can use prediction models to determine if a student will do well on a future test

-   You can use prediction models to infer if a student’s performance right now is associated with successfully demonstrating a skill

## Different than measuring performance

-   Inferring if a student’s performance right now is associated with successfully demonstrating a skill

-   Not the same as knowing whether the student has a skill, which is not directly observable

    -   Maybe they appeared to demonstrate skill without having it (“guess”)

    -   Maybe they appeared to not demonstrate skill despite having it (“slip”)

## How do we get at latent knowledge?

-   We can’t measure it directly

-   We can’t look directly into the brain

-   Yet

-   But we can look at performance

-   And we can look at performance over time

    -   More information than performance at one specific moment

## Not trivial…

-   This is a research problem with a long history…

## This week

-   We will cover some of the key approaches for knowledge tracing, within EDM

-   We will differentiate knowledge tracing from measuring learning from tests

    -   Different goal

    -   Different mathematical methods

## What’s the difference?

-   Tests

    -   Learning is not changing while it’s being measured

-   Digital Learning Platforms

    -   Learning is changing while it’s being measured

    -   Often the measurements themselves are changing learning

## Purposes of knowledge tracing

-   Mastery learning

## Purposes of knowledge tracing

-   Use in analyses

-   We will discuss in detail throughout the week but examples include

    -   Finding content that is too hard or too easy

    -   Finding content with bad properties

    -   Studying effectiveness of hints or learning materials

    -   As components in various other models (disengagement, affect, self-regulated learning)

    -   As predictors of external knowledge measures (such as standardized examinations)

## What applications are you interested in?

-   How do you envision possibly using KT?

-   What kind of contexts would you be interested in using KT in?
