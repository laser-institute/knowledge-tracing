## A Little History

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The classic approach for measuring tightly defined skills in online learning

-   First proposed by Richard Atkinson

-   Most thoroughly articulated and studied by Albert Corbett and John Anderson @corbett1994knowledge

## Flexibility of BKT

-   Been around a long time

-   Still as of today the most widely-used knowledge tracing algorithm used at scale

    -   Interpretable

    -   Predictable

    -   Decent performance

# Goal & Assumptions

## The Key Goal of BKT

-   Measuring how well a student knows a specific skill/knowledge component at a specific time

-   Based on their past history of performance with that skill/KC

:::

## What is the typical use of BKT?

-   Assess a student’s knowledge of skill/KC X

-   Based on a sequence of items that are scored between 0 and 1

-   Classically 0 **or** 1, but there are variants that relax this

-   Where each item corresponds to a single skill

-   Where the student can learn on each item, due to help, feedback, scaffolding, etc.

:::

## Key assumptions of BKT

-   Each item must involve a single latent trait or skill

    -   Different from PFA, which we’ll talk about next lecture

-   Each skill has four parameters

-   Only the first attempt on each item matters

    -   i.e. is included in calculations

## Key assumptions of BKT Cont.

-   Each skill has four parameters

-   From these parameters, and the pattern of successes and failures the student has had on each relevant skill so far

-   We can compute 

    -   Latent knowledge P(Ln) 

    -   The probability P(CORR) that the learner will get the item correct

## Key assumptions of BKT

-   Two-state learning model

-   Each skill is either learned or unlearned

-   In problem-solving, the student can learn a skill at each opportunity to apply the skill

-   Each problem (opportunity) has the same chance of learning.

-   A student does not forget a skill, once he or she knows it

## Model Performance Assumptions

-   If the student knows a skill, there is still some chance the student will slip and make a mistake.

-   If the student does not know a skill, there is still some chance the student will guess correctly.

## Learning Parameters

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Two [**Learning**]{.underline} Parameters

1.  **p(L0).** Probability the skill is already known before the first opportunity to use the skill in problem solving.

2.  **p(T)**. Probability the skill will be learned at each opportunity to use the skill.

## Performance Parameters

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Two [**Performance**]{.underline} Parameters

1.  **p(G).** Probability the student will guess correctly if the skill is not known.

2.  **p(S)**. Probability the student will slip (make a mistake) if the skill is known.

## Example

P(L0) = 0.4, P(T) = 0.1, P(S) = 0.3, P(G) = 0.2

<br>

| Actual | P(Ln-1) | P(Ln-1\|actual) | P(Ln) |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
|        | 0.4     |                 |       |
|        |         |                 |       |
|        |         |                 |       |
|        |         |                 |       |
