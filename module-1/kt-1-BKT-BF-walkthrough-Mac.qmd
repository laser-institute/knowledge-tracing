# Introduction

This guide seeks to help beginners with Java Environment Setup, JetBrain IntelliJ IDEA installation, and run Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Brute Force model fitting code(BFK-BF) by Baker, Corbett, Gowda, Wagner, MacLaren, Kauffman, Mitchell, & Giguere(2010).

This BKT-BF walkthrough guide is based on Macbook Air 2020, M1. We will specify when you need to pay attention to anything here.

# **Section 1: Java IDE and Environment Setup**

# **Section 2: BKT-BF**

## Java Test Run

Now Let’s try create your first Java project, click **New Project**

![](images/CreateProject.png)

1.  Then, change the name of your project, Check Add sample code(No need for future projects, just for testing).

## BKT-BF

We successfully installed the Java environment and IDEA. Now we come to the actual BKT-BF code @baker2010contextual.

Please download the BKT-BF with this link: <https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/ryanbaker/BKT-BruteForce.zip>

For copyright statement, please refer to <https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/ryanbaker/edmtools.html>

1.  Extract BKT-BruteForce.zip

2.  Copy computeKTparamsAll.java, right click on the src folder, then click Paste, then click OK

    ![](images/RightClick-Paste.png)

    ![](images/Paste-Yes.png)

3.  Similarly, copy TestData.txt, and paste to the root folder. Mine’s name is MyFirstJava

    ![](images/Paste-Data.png) 

4.  Now you may run the BKT-BF file, click Run, you should see:

    ![](images/FitModelResult.png)

This output means: The best parameters for Skill META-DETERMINE-DXO are: L0 = 0.001, G=0.001, S=0.1 T=0.724 The best parameters for Skill META-DETERMINE-MIDDLE-GENE are: L0 = 0.001 G=0.235 S=0.1 T=0.09

5.  Now you successfully ran the BKF-BF fitting method, If you have any data of your own, you can fit your BKT model to your own data! Just match the format in File. (TestData.txt)
