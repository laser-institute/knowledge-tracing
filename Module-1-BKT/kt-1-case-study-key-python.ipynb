        "1.  `for _, row in student_attributes.iterrows():`\n",
        "    -   This line starts a loop that iterates through each row of the `student_attributes` DataFrame. The `iterrows()` function generates a sequence of index and row pairs for the DataFrame. Here, `_` is a placeholder for the row index, which is not used in the loop, and `row` represents the actual data of the current row as a Series object.\n",
        "2.  `node_id = row['id']`\n",
        "    -   For each row, this line extracts the value from the 'id' column, which is assumed to represent the unique identifier (ID) of a student. This ID will be used to reference the corresponding node in the `student_network` graph.\n",
        "3.  `if node_id in student_network:`\n",
        "    -   This conditional statement checks if a node with the ID `node_id` exists in the `student_network` graph. This is important to avoid attempting to set attributes for non-existent nodes.\n",
        "4.  Inside the `if` block, the following lines set attributes for the node corresponding to `node_id` in the `student_network` graph:\n",
        "    -   `student_network.nodes[node_id]['gender'] = row['gender']`\n",
        "        -   This line sets the 'gender' attribute of the node to the value found in the 'gender' column of the current row.\n",
        "    -   `student_network.nodes[node_id]['achievement'] = row['achievement']`\n",
        "        -   This line sets the 'achievement' attribute of the node to the value found in the 'achievement' column of the current row.\n",
        "    -   `student_network.nodes[node_id]['gender_num'] = row['gender_num']`\n",
        "        -   This line sets the 'gender_num' attribute (likely a numerical representation of gender) of the node to the value found in the 'gender_num' column of the current row.\n",
        "    -   `student_network.nodes[node_id]['achievement_num'] = row['achievement_num']`\n",
        "        -   This line sets the 'achievement_num' attribute (possibly a numerical representation of achievement level) of the node to the value found in the 'achievement_num' column of the current row.\n",

It does so by running a large number of simulations. These simulations generate random matrices with sizes and value distributions based on the original two matrices being tested.\n",

        "The final step in the workflow/process is sharing the results of your analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al. @krumm2018 have outlined the following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders findings from an analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Select.** Communicating what one has learned involves selecting among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form, i.e.¬†a \"data product.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products, research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with colors and shapes to highlight key points.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Narrate.** Writing a narrative to accompany the data products involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related research question, describing how best to interpret the data product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question and might be used to inform new analyses or a \"change idea\" for improving student learning.\n",
