## Is future correctness enough?

-   Up until this point we‚Äôve been talking about predicting future correctness

## But what if you forget it tomorrow?

-   Another way to look at knowledge is ‚Äì how long will you remember it?

## Relevant for all knowledge

-   Mostly considered in the context of memory for facts, rather than skills

-   How do you say banana in Spanish?

-   What is the capital of New York?

-   Where are the Islands of Langerhans?

## Most Common Application Areas

-   Flashcard apps

-   Language learning apps

## Spacing Effect

-   It has long been known that spaced practice (i.e. pausing between studying the same fact) is better than massed practice (i.e. cramming)

-   Early adaptive systems implemented this behavior in simple ways @leitner1972so

## ACT-R Memory Equations @pavlik2005practice

-   Memory duration can be understood in terms of memory strength (referred to as activation)

## ACT-R Memory Equations @pavlik2005practice

-   Formula for probability of remembering

$$
P(m) = \frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\tau-m}{s}}}
$$

-   Where m = activation strength of current fact t = threshold parameter for how hard it is to remember s is noise parameter for how sensitive memory is to changes in activation

-   Note logistic function (like PFA)

## ACT-R Memory Equations @pavlik2005practice

-   Formula for activation

$$
m_{n}(t_{1..n}) = \ln ()\sum_i^n t_{i}^{-d}
$$

-   We have a sequence of n cases where the learner encountered the fact

-   Each ùë°_ùëñ represents how long ago the learner encountered the fact for the i-th time

-   The decay parameter d represents the speed of forgetting under exponential decay

## ACT-R Memory Equations @pavlik2005practice

-   Implications

-   More practice = better memory

-   More time between practices = better memory

-   Most efficient learning comes from dense practice followed by expanding amounts of time in between practices @pavlik2008using

## MCM @Mozer2009PredictingTO

-   Postulates that decay speed drops, the more times a fact is encountered

-   Functionally complex model where

-   Knowledge strength (and therefore probability of remembering) is a function of the sum of the traces‚Äô actual contributions, divided by the product of their potential contributions

-   Power function is estimated as a combination of exponential functions

## DASH @mozer2016predicting

-   DASH Extends previous approaches to also include item difficulty and latent student ability

-   Can use either MCM or ACT-R as its internal representation of how memory decays over time

## Duolingo @settles2016trainable

-   Fits regression model to predict both recall and estimated half-life of memory (based on lag time)

-   Based on estimate of exponential decay of memory

## Duolingo @settles2016trainable

-   Uses feature set including

    -   Time since word last seen

    -   Total number of times student has seen the word

    -   Total number of times student has correctly recalled the word

    -   Total number of times student has failed to recalled the word Word difficulty

## Another Key Memory Phenomenon

-   Spreading Activation

    -   Encountering or recalling something in memory also increases memory activation of related concepts/facts/ideas @anderson1983spreading

    -   @ma2023each build a DKT-family algorithm for memory that uses associations between items along these lines

## And of course‚Ä¶

-   Remember what we talked about earlier this week on integrating time into DKT-family algorithms and LKT-family algorithms

## When to use memory models

-   You care about memory for specific items

    -   If you care about memory for skills, see LKT extensions that include time

-   Forgetting is a real concern ‚Äì the student can do it today, not tomorrow

-   Relatively small amounts of data OK

-   Once you have a memory model, you can safely add new items to it and it will work

    -   Many algorithms don‚Äôt have item-specific parameters at all
